# TinyApp
### a real tiny app by William Mairs

This app is an exceedingly simple message displayer.  The user is prompted to enter their name, and then the app displays a cheery personalized message and a photo of my cat, Dennis (a.k.a. Sweetboy).

#### Usage
Usage is straightforward: the user inputs their first name and last name and clicks a button.
#### Running Requirements
This app requires Android 7.0 (Nougat)
#### Resources Used
I relied heavily on the Android Developer documentation, in addition to sporatic help from Stack Overflow.
#### Things I Learned
I learned a great many things.
+ How to do Anything at All in the Android Studio
+ What an Intent is for (although what's really going on with Intets is still a bit of a mystery)
+ How the ConstraintLayout works (it's pretty weird, but handy)
+ Images must be appropriately sized or they'll break your app
+ Android Studio handles a lot of the XML stuff for you, but there's times when it pays big to add things on your own, like a Layout's parent
+ Passing data around between Views really isn't so wild
+ Although mobile dev is a big and crazy Frontier, it's easy enough to find some space in a framework (like Android Studio) and fall back on the documentation
